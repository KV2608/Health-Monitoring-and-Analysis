**Health Monitoring and Analysis using Python**

**Objective:**
Analyze health data to monitor and evaluate key health metrics.

**Data Cleaning:**
- Addressed null values in body temperature and oxygen saturation columns by filling them with median values.

**Analysis:**
- **Summary Statistics:** Analyzed numerical health metrics including Age, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Saturation to understand typical values and data spread.
- **Visualizations:** Created visualizations to illustrate the distributions of these metrics.

**Gender Distribution:**
- Visualized the gender distribution showing a nearly even split with males comprising 51.2%.

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Generated a correlation matrix revealing no strong correlations between health metrics.

**Activity Level Analysis:**
- Examined heart rate by different activity levels, noting unusual patterns in heart rate for running versus walking, suggesting similar variability in heart rates for these activities.

**Blood Pressure Analysis:**
- Analyzed the distribution of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Systolic blood pressure had a broader distribution with peaks around 120 mmHg and 140 mmHg, while diastolic pressure had a narrower distribution with a significant peak around 80 mmHg.

**Gender-Specific Analysis:**
- Compared heart rate and oxygen saturation between genders, finding similar median values and interquartile ranges, indicating no significant difference between genders in this dataset.

**Additional Insights:**
- Explored the relationship between respiratory rate and activity level, noting higher median rates for walking and running compared to resting.
- Observed an upward trend in body temperature from resting to running, consistent with physiological responses to exercise.

This project demonstrates the application of data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques using Python to monitor and analyze health data, providing insights into various health metrics and their distributions within the sampled population.
